<!--  -->
If you are trying to improve the performace of a section of code, then it is better to change the code step by step.
That is to say, make a change, test it, and then make another change. Becuase you intution (or) expected output may not be correct.
It might lead to race conditions (or) sequential inconsistency (or) working on some inputs and not working on others (or) might conflict with another optimization (this is tougher to handle).
